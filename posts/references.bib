	abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

	abstract = {This paper presents Open Data Kit (ODK), an extensible, open-source suite of tools designed to build information services for developing regions. ODK currently provides four tools to this end: Collect, Aggregate, Voice, and Build. Collect is a mobile platform that renders application logic and supports the manipulation of data. Aggregate provides a “click-to-deploy” server that supports data storage and transfer in the “cloud” or on local servers. Voice renders application logic using phone prompts that users respond to with keypad presses. Finally, Build is a application designer that generates the logic used by the tools. Designed to be used together or independently, ODK core tools build on existing open standards and are supported by an open-source community that has contributed additional tools. We describe four deployments that demonstrate how the decisions made in the system architecture of ODK enable services that can both push and pull information in developing regions.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents the Open Data Kit (ODK) project’s design, challenges, development, and evolution of configurable software frameworks and their international development impacts. The ODK project created a suite of mobile data collection tools designed to help organizations working in resource-constrained contexts collect, aggregate, and analyze data. ODK mobile tools are designed to maintain their functionality in locations with limited, intermittent, or no Internet connectivity. While the first set of ODK tools has experienced wide adoption with millions of users collecting data, its primary use case of unidirectional data flowing from the field to a central repository could not be adapted to certain use cases. To broaden the scope of potential applications, a second generation of tools was developed that added support for bidirectional data management applications. This chapter discusses the iterative research and development process of the ODK project.},
